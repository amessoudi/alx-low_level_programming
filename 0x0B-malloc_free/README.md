Checking Memory Leaks with Valgrind
Automatic vs Dynamic Allocation
Automatic memory allocation happens when variables are declared. This memory is automatically released when the variables go out of scope. On the contrary, dynamic allocation involves manually managing memory, giving the programmer more flexibility but also more responsibility.

Usage of malloc and free
malloc is a function that allows programmers to allocate a specific amount of memory during the execution of a program. It returns a pointer to the first byte of the block of memory. free is used to release this memory when it's no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.

Importance of Memory Management
Memory management is crucial for resource optimization and ensuring the smooth running of applications. Inefficient memory usage can lead to issues like memory leaks, which can cause programs to use increasing amounts of memory over time.

Checking Memory Leaks with Valgrind
Valgrind is a powerful tool used to detect memory leaks and other memory-related issues in a program. By running a program through Valgrind, it can alert you to any memory that hasn't been freed, helping ensure efficient memory usage.
