# 0x08-Recursion Project - ALX Software Engineering

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program, focusing on mastering the concept of recursion in C programming.

## Description

The `0x08-recursion` project explores various aspects of recursion, a fundamental programming concept where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. It provides practical implementations and examples illustrating how recursion can be used to solve problems in a clear and efficient manner.
