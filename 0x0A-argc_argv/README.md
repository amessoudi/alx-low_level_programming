# Command Line Arguments in C

In this project, we'll explore how command-line arguments work in the C programming language.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Understand and utilize arguments passed to their C programs.
- Differentiate between the two main prototypes and know when to use each.
- Use `__attribute__((unused))` and `(void)` to handle unused variables or parameters during compilation.

### General Knowledge

- **Using Program Arguments:** Learn how to capture and manipulate arguments provided at the command line during program execution.
  
- **Main Prototypes:** Discover the two primary prototypes for the `main` function and understand the scenarios in which each is applicable.

- **Handling Unused Variables or Parameters:** Dive into techniques such as `__attribute__((unused))` and `(void)` to efficiently manage unused parameters or variables, preventing compilation warnings or errors.
