# More Malloc, Free

In this project, we delve deeper into dynamic memory allocation in C programming, exploring advanced functionalities and understanding their internals.

## Resources

**Reading Material:**
- [Do I cast the result of malloc?] (http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html)

**Manual Pages:**
- `man 3 exit`
- `man 3 calloc`
- `man 3 realloc`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

### General
- Understand and explain the use of the `exit` function.
- Describe the purpose and usage of the functions `calloc` and `realloc` from the standard library.
- Differentiate between memory allocation methods and when to use each.
- Implement dynamic memory allocation in various scenarios with a focus on best practices.
